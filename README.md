# Artifical_Neural_Networks_CW

An artificial neural network (ANN) is a flexible mathematical structure which is capable of identifying complex nonlinear relationships between input and output data sets [1].
Normally consisting of an input of neurons, one or two hidden layers of neurons, and a final layer of output neurons [2],they have interesting physical properties and rich applications [3].
The simplest form of  an ANN is a single layer perceptron (SLP); this consists of a single neuron with adjustable weights and bias [4].
A perceptron can be trained by the use of patterns which are drawn from two linearly separable classes (e.g. class 0 and class 1), the SLP will converge and position the decision surface in the form of a hyperplane between the two classes [4] [5].

This project used training data to train an ANN, this was then tested using testing data.
